## Disclaimer

This is just a hobby project. It is very far from being production ready!

## Intro

**Rym** is a statically typed programming language inspired by Rust, Swift, Python and others.
It focuses on **ease of use** and **should just workâ„¢**. </br>

Big thanks to Robert Nystrom and his book [crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com)
which inspired me to start and continue working on this language.

## Examples

```rym
const game = fn(x: Uint) String => {
    const rule = fn(acc, num, word) =>
        if (x mod num) == 0 then acc ++ word else acc;

    const default_rule = fn(acc) =>
        if acc == "" then acc else x.to_string();

    "".rule(3, "Fizz")
      .rule(5, "Buzz")
      .rule(7, "Splash")
      .default_rule()
}

const main = fn() {
    for i in 0..=100:
        println(game(i))
}
```

```rust
const main = fn() @Io, Result[(), Error] => {
    let msg = "Hello World";
    println(msg);

    let mut num = 2/4 * (10 - 1);
    println("Number:", num);

    const msg = msg + "!";
    println("Combined:", msg, num);
}
```

Early returns when unwrapping `Tryable`s

```rust
const main = fn() @Io, Result[i32, String] => {
    let number = maybe_error().try;
    println(number);

    // Same as
    let number = match maybe_error():
        | Ok(inner) => inner,
        | Err(err) => return Err(err);
    println(number);
}
```

<!-- Tryable chaining

```dart
const chained = maybe_error()&.to_string()

// Short form of:
const chained = match maybe_error() {
    Ok(val) => Ok(val.to_string()),
    err => err,
}
// or:
const chained = maybe_error().and_then(|val| Ok(val.to_string()))
``` -->

## About

### Name

-   **R**ust**y** â‡’ Heavily borrows ðŸ™ƒ from Rust
-   **M**ulti-paradigm â‡’ Mix of object oriented, procedural and functional programming
-   Programming **Lang**uage â‡’ because thats what it is

### Goals

The language should be as powerful as possible while only providing a small set of consistent features. (Kind of like Go)

Apart from that Rym just gets used to try out a bunch of my ideas...
I am trying my best to combine all of them in a meaningful manner ;)

-   Features
    -   Static types
        -   inferred
    -   Complex types
        -   struct
        -   enum / tagged union
    -   Iterators
    -   Zig like comp time
-   Nice developer experience
    -   Informative errors and warnings
    -   Builtin tools
        -   First party REPL
        -   Package manager

## Project Structure

The project is split into many crates that are part of one Cargo workspace:

`crates/rymx` â‡’ command line tool for executing `.rym` files

### Tests

For now just run `cargo test`, there is no special setup.

**TODO**

## Todos

-   [ ] add benchmarking capabilities
