# Rym

**Rym** is a statically typed programming language inspired by Rust, Swift, Python and others that focuses on **ease of use** and **should just workâ„¢**.
Big thanks go to Robert Nystrom and his book [crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) open source which inspired me to continue working on this language.

## About Rym

### Name

- **R**ust**y** â‡’ Heavily borrows ðŸ™ƒ from Rust
- **M**ulti-paradigm â‡’ Mix of object oriented, procedural and functional programming
- Programming **Lang**uage â‡’ because thats what it is

### Goals

The language should be as powerful as possible while only providing a small set of consistent features.
(Kinda like Go)

- Features
  - Static types
    - inferred
  - Complex types
    - struct
    - enum / tagged union
  - Iterators
  - Zig like comp time
- Nice developer experience
  - Informative errors and warnings
  - Builtin tools
    - First party REPL
    - Package manager

## Examples

```dart
const main = fn() @Io, Result<(), Error> => {
	const msg = "Hello World";
	println(msg);

	let mut num = 2/4 * (10 - 1);
	println("Number:", num);

	const msg = msg + "!";
	println("Combined:", msg, num);
}
```

Early returns when unwrapping `Tryable`s

```dart
const main = fn() Result<Number, String> => {
	const number = maybe_error()?;
	println(number);

	// Same as
	const inner = match maybe_error() with
		| Ok(val) => val,
		| err => return err;
	println(inner);
}
```

<!-- Tryable chaining

```dart
const chained = maybe_error()&.to_string()

// Short form of:
const chained = match maybe_error() {
	Ok(val) => Ok(val.to_string()),
	err => err,
}
// or:
const chained = maybe_error().and_then(|val| Ok(val.to_string()))
``` -->

## Project Structure

The project is split into many crates that are part of one Cargo workspace:

`crates/rymx` â‡’ command line tool for executing `.rym` files

### Tests

For now just run `cargo test`, there is no special setup.

**TODO**

# Todos

- [ ] add benchmarking capabilities
