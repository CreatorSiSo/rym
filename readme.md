## Disclaimer

**⚠️ This is just a hobby project. It is very far from being production ready! ⚠️**

## Intro

**Rym** is a statically typed programming language inspired by Rust, Swift, Python and others.
It focuses on **ease of use** and **should just work™**. </br>

Big thanks to Robert Nystrom and his book [crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com)
which inspired me to start and continue working on this language.

## Examples

```rust
fn main() ~Io {
    for i in 0..=100:
        println(game(i));
}

fn game(x: Uint) String => {
    const rule = fn(acc, num, word) =>
        if (x mod num) == 0 then acc ++ word else acc;

    const default_rule = fn(acc) =>
        if acc == "" then acc else x.to_string();

    "".rule(3, "Fizz")
      .rule(5, "Buzz")
      .rule(7, "Splash")
      .default_rule()
}
```

```rust
fn main() ~Io, Result[(), Error] => {
    let msg = "Hello World";
    println(msg);

    let mut num = 2/4 * (10 - 1);
    println("Number:", num);

    const msg = msg + "!";
    println("Combined:", msg, num);
}
```

Early returns when unwrapping `Tryable`s

```rust
fn main() Result[String, SpecificError] => {
    let chained = maybe_error().try;
    // Same as:
    let expanded = match maybe_error():
        | Ok(val) => Ok(val.to_string()),
        \ err => return err;

    // ...
    Ok(chained)
}
```

<!--
```rust
const chained = maybe_error()&.to_string()

// Short form of:
const chained = match maybe_error():
    | Ok(val) => Ok(val.to_string()),
    \ err => err;
// or:
const chained = maybe_error().and_then(fn(val) Ok(val.to_string()))
```
-->

## About

### Name

-   **R**ust**y** ⇒ Heavily borrows 🙃 from Rust
-   **M**ulti-paradigm ⇒ Mix of object oriented, procedural and functional programming
-   Programming **Lang**uage ⇒ because thats what it is

### Goals

The language should be as powerful as possible while only providing a small set of consistent features. (Kind of like Go)

Apart from that Rym just gets used to try out a bunch of my ideas...
I am trying my best to combine all of them in a meaningful manner ;)

-   Features
    -   Static types
        -   inferred
    -   Complex types
        -   struct
        -   enum / tagged union
    -   Iterators
    -   Zig like comp time
-   Nice developer experience
    -   Informative errors and warnings
    -   Builtin tools
        -   First party REPL
        -   Package manager

## Project Structure

The project is split into many crates that are part of one Cargo workspace:

`crates/rymx` ⇒ command line tool for executing `.rym` files

### Tests

For now just run `cargo test`, there is no special setup.

**TODO**

## Todos

-   [ ] add benchmarking capabilities
