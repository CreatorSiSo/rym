# Rym

**Rym Lang** or just **Rym** is a statically typed 'mid-level' programming language inspired by and written in Rust for educational purposes. Big thanks go to Robert Nystrom who made his book [crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) open source which enabled me to read it and learn a lot :).

## About Rym

### Goals

- Enjoyable DX (Development Experience)
  - Informative errors and warnings
  - Built in tools
- Safe programming language
  - No `null` `nil` `undefined`
  - Static but inferred types
- Should work as a scripting language
- Great interoperabilty with Rust
  - Should just work out of the box
- Ui and apps programming

### Name

- **R**ust**y** â‡’ Heavily borrows ðŸ™ƒ from Rust
- **M**ulti-paradigm â‡’ Mix of object oriented, procedural and functional programming
- Programming **Lang**uage â‡’ because thats what it is

## Project Structure

The project is split into many crates that are part of one Cargo workspace:

`crates/rym_span` â‡’ Span
`crates/rym_tt` â‡’ TokenTree, TokenStream
`crates/rym_lexer` â‡’ Isolated initial lexer

`crates/ast` â‡’ Ast Types: Spanned<T>, AstVisitor<T>, Token, ...
`crates/lex` â‡’ produce Tokens from source
`crates/parse` â‡’ produce ast from tokens
`crates/code_gen` â‡’ generate optimized code (dead code analysis, ...) or give warnings
`crates/tree_walk` â‡’ evaluate ast
`crates/tests` â‡’ integration tests
`crates/rymx` â‡’ command line tool for executing `.rym` files

And some other scripts located in the root directory:

`bench.sh` â‡’ builds and runs various benchmarks
`test.py` â‡’ updates and runs all tests

### Tests

Run `python test.py` to update and execute all tests.

This internally runs `cargo r --bin gen -- ./crates/tests/src/integration` which includes the source code for all tests into `crates/tests/src/integration/mod.rs`.

# Todos

- [ ] Interpreter
  - [ ] add method for defining variable on interpreter directly
- [ ] add benchmarking capabilities
  - [ ] cargo alias eg. `cargo bench`
- [ ] use arena allocator for scopes
  - [ ] benchmark before & after
- [ ] use logos lexer generator
- [ ] errors
  - [ ] use `Spanned<T>` where possible
  - [x] construct error location from `Span` and source (file)
  - [x] use annotations lib to display errors
  - [ ] implement error recovery to safe expr/stmt
  - [ ] use error codes that link to a more detailed explanation (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_error_codes)
  - [ ] `true && (break)` currently only returns `Error: Expected Literal got RightParen, Span: 14..14`, it should also say something along the lines of: `Tip: insert expression or semicolon after break`
- [ ] types
  - [ ] `Number`, `String`, `Char`, `Bool`
  - [ ] (literal) values that come from source code directly:
    - [ ] `LiteralNumber`, `LiteralString`, `LiteralChar`, `LiteralBool`
    - [ ] `1`, `2.2`, `"Hello World!"`, `'\n'`, `false`
  - [ ] type unions: `0 | 1 | Bool`
  - [ ] type functions [docs/functions.md](docs/functions.md#type_functions)
