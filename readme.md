# Rym

**Rym** is a statically typed programming language inspired by Rust, Swift, Python and others that focuses on **ease of use** and **should just workâ„¢**.
Big thanks go to Robert Nystrom and his book [crafting interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) open source which inspired me to continue working on this language.

## About Rym

### Name

- **R**ust**y** â‡’ Heavily borrows ðŸ™ƒ from Rust
- **M**ulti-paradigm â‡’ Mix of object oriented, procedural and functional programming
- Programming **Lang**uage â‡’ because thats what it is

### Goals

- Features
  - Static types
  - Complex types (structs, enums, ..)
  - Union types
  - Iterators
  - Inferred types
  - Constant evaluation context
  - Tryable chaining?
- Nice Development Experience
  - Informative errors and warnings
  - Builtin tools
    - First party REPL
    - Package manager

## Examples

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Error>, ?Io => {
	const msg = "Hello World";
	print(msg);

	let mut num = 2/4 * (10 - 1);
	print("Number:", num);

	const msg = msg + "!";
	print("Combined:", msg, num);
}
```

Early returns when unwrapping `Tryable`s

```rust
fn main() -> Result<Number, String> => {
	const number = maybe_error()?;
	print(number);

	// Same as
	const inner = match maybe_error() {
		Ok(val) => val,
		err => return err,
	};
	print(inner);
}
```

<!-- Tryable chaining

```rust
const chained = maybe_error()&.to_string()

// Short form of:
const chained = match maybe_error() {
	Ok(val) => Ok(val.to_string()),
	err => err,
}
// or:
const chained = maybe_error().and_then(|val| Ok(val.to_string()))
``` -->

### Tests

**TODO**

# Todos

- [ ] use insta snapshot testing crate
